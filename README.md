# Gallons-Of-Water

The other day, my roommate who works at Goldman Sachs as a software engineer gave me one of the programming challenges they use to recruit programmers. The problem is called gallons of water and consists of the following:

You are provided with an array of N integer values. Imagine the array is the shape of the bottom of a 2D pool and you have to calculate how much water is needed to fill the pool.

Some examples: 
- For an array A = [3, 4, 1, 5] the answer is 3.
- For an array A = [6, 0, 0, 6] the answer is 12.
- For an array A = [2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1] the answer is 0.

I have never been good at these programming challenges. I always look for the most optimal solution but with the little time they give the interviewees I lose concentration and end up stressing myself until I give up.
I probably would not have passed the interview, however, after he showed me the most optimal solution I told him that I thought I could develop a faster solution using AI.

My idea was to create a data generator using the programmatic solution and overfit my model by training it infinite number of times to achieve 100% accuracy.

I did not have the time or computer power to train my model infinite number of epochs, but I discovered some very interesting insights about the training process. 

If you want to know what I learnt let me know and I will be happy to share it. Or try to optimize the model by yourself and try to achieve 100% accuracy.
